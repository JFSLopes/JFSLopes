# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jos√© Lopes  

I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the **Master‚Äôs in Informatics and Computing Engineering** at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.inicial).  
I enjoy building software from scratch, exploring low-level system details, and applying computer science concepts to real-world projects.
