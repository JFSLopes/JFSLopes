# 👋 Hi, I’m José Lopes  

I’m currently enrolled in the **Master’s in Informatics and Computing Engineering** at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.inicial).  
I enjoy building software from scratch, exploring low-level system details, and applying computer science concepts to real-world projects.

## 🚀 School Projects  
Here I’ll showcase some of the most interesting academic projects I’ve worked on:  

| Course Name | Project | Description | Grade | Link |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------|------|
| Compilers | JmmCompiler | Comprehensive compiler pipeline implementation, covering parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate representation (IR) generation, and final code generation targeting Jasmin assembly language. | 20/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/JmmCompiler) |
| Graphical Computation | HeliSim | Developed a 3D scene using a custom framework to control a helicopter, with shaders, objects, and animations. | 18.4/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/HeliSim) |
| Laboratório de Bases de Dados e Aplicações Web | Online Auction Platform | Built a web application using Laravel, PostgreSQL, and external APIs to implement an online auction platform. | 17.4/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/online-auction-platform) |
| Algorithms and Data Structures | Student Schedule Manager | Efficiently manages student schedules using appropriate data structures. | 16.7/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/AED_Project) |
| Algorithms and Data Structures | Air Travel Flight Management System | Implemented a graph-based system to manage airports and flights: network statistics, critical airport detection, and best flight search with filters. | 18.1/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/AED_PROJECT2) |
| Algorithm Design | Delivery System | Designed and implemented algorithms on a custom graph to analyze a water distribution network: max flow (Edmonds-Karp), load balancing, failure impact, and flow resilience. | 18.9/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/DA_FirstProject) |
| Algorithm Design | TSP | Solved the Traveling Salesman Problem with heuristics and approximation algorithms (Nearest Neighbor, Christofides, Triangular Approximation, 2-Opt) to handle large real-world graphs. | 18.9/20 | [Repository](https://github.com/JFSLopes/DA_SecondProject) |
